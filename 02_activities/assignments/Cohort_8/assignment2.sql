-- COALESCE
/* 1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! 
We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:

SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product


But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first column with
nulls, and 'unit' for the second column with nulls. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. 
The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. 
Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. 
All the other rows will remain the same. */

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on

(without purchase details) and number those visits.

| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

Hint: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. */

2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create

3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day,

Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

HINT: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. 
Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. 
Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)?
How many customers are there (y). 
Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x*y).  */

Then, using UPDATE, change the current_quantity equal to the last quantity value from the vendor_inventory details.

HINT: This one is pretty hard. 
First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. 
Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) 
Third, SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...), remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. 
Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, 
	you'll need to use product_units.product_id to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. 
When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement. */
